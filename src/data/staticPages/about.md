# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Angelo, a software engineer!

I build products with React, Node.js, and Python. I'm based in Vancouver, Canada. I have weekend office hours where we can talk about programming, software projects, or anything that can further our careers. Try finding me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angeloaldecoa), [Github](https://www.github.com/noxolica), or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ak.angelo).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  

## Now

- I'm currently looking for software engineering roles. Reach out to me if you're looking for someone who does fullstack development (preferably with JavaScript).

## Past

- Ex-software engineer at [Sparx Publishing Group](https://www.sparxpg.com) from 2018-2021.
- Ex-software engineer intern at [Fitplan](https://www.fitplan.com) from 2017-2018.
- I tried to build an alternative healthcare marketplace when I was at this [startup incubator in Vancouver](https://www.start.entrepreneurship.ubc.ca/venturebuilding) in 2019. Our team failed miserably, but I learned a lot from doing boots-on-the-ground market research.
